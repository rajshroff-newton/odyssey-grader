This creates the central tension in the current BTC setup: crypto-specific demand is improving, but macro liquidity remains restrictive.\n\n4.

For a technology-heavy index, this matters directly: higher risk-free rates increase the discount rate applied to long-duration earnings, putting pressure on equity valuations even when company fundamentals remain unchanged. Heavy Treasury supply and weaker foreign demand are also keeping term premiums elevated, reinforcing the rate headwind.\n\n2. Inflation remains too sticky for an easy policy pivot\nU.S. CPI held at 3.40% YoY and 0.10% MoM. Inflation is no longer accelerating sharply, but it remains high enough to constrain the Federal Reserve's ability to ease policy aggressively. That leaves Nasdaq exposed to a \"higher-for-longer\" rate environment.\n\n3. Growth is weakening at an awkward time\nRetail sales fell 0.60% MoM, while core retail sales declined 0.30%. Normally, weaker consumption could support expectations for easier monetary policy. But with inflation still elevated, softer growth currently creates a less favorable combination: slower demand without immediate relief from high discount rates.\n\n4. FOMC communication is the next catalyst\nThe upcoming FOMC minutes are important because the market needs clarity on whether policymakers are becoming more concerned about slowing growth or remain primarily focused on inflation persistence. A hawkish interpretation would likely keep yields elevated and prolong valuation pressure. A more dovish signal could reduce the discount-rate headwind, but follow-through would still require confirmation from subsequent inflation and labor-market data.",

The 10-day average was also above the 20-day average, confirming stronger short-term momentum and supporting a cautiously bullish structure toward $1.55, although the separation left the trend extended.\n\nRange Position: The 30-day range was $0.99 to $1.70, with the current price at $1.46. This placed XRP in the upper portion of the range rather than at the midpoint. The $1.40 area remained the key support, and a sustained break below it would require the rebound structure to be reassessed.\n\nTrading Volume: The latest volume was 113.19 million, compared with a seven-day average of 294.08 million, or 0.38 times the average. Contracting participation was a risk to the ETF- and institutional-demand thesis because a retest of $1.55 would require renewed volume expansion, while continued contraction could limit upside follow-through.",

Momentum remained positive, but recent gains were losing breadth.\n\nStrong AI guidance supported technology shares, while inflation and potential semiconductor tariffs could keep valuations sensitive to yields and policy risk.\n\nThe near-term direction was cautiously higher above 7,700, but a break below that level would favor a deeper pullback toward 7,600.",

Upside momentum remained intact, but market breadth still required confirmation.\n\nThe near-term bias remained cautiously higher while the index held above 7,700.

        body: "AI capital spending: Nvidia's projection for roughly 70% revenue growth and its stronger earnings outlook reinforced confidence in technology and data-center demand. That supported the cautiously higher bias, but concentration in AI leadership left valuations sensitive to any disappointment.\n\nInflation and Federal Reserve policy: Core PCE inflation remained elevated at 3.30% year over year, while quarterly headline and core measures accelerated to 5.30% and 4.90%. Reduced confidence in near-term easing could keep yields restrictive and limit valuation expansion.\n\nSemiconductor tariff risk: Potential duties on chips and chip-intensive products could raise data-center costs, disrupt supply chains, and pressure corporate margins. Policy uncertainty therefore remained a constraint on technology breadth and could amplify downside risk below key market support.",
