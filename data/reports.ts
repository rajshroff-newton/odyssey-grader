Network development strengthens the medium-term thesis\nOngoing network upgrades and expanded real-world payment infrastructure improve Solana's utility and execution capacity.\n\nProposed fee reforms could further strengthen SOL's token economics through increased burn, although their market impact will depend on implementation and actual network activity.\n\nKey Risk\nRegulatory uncertainty and uneven market participation remain the main constraints.

This remains the clearest positive structural driver, particularly if institutional exposure continues expanding.\n\n2. A softer dollar improves the liquidity backdrop\nDollar weakness reduces currency headwinds for global investors and generally improves financial conditions for risk assets. For BTC, this complements ETF demand by creating a more supportive external liquidity environment.\n\n3. High Treasury yields remain the main macro constraint\nElevated yields increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and tighten overall financial conditions. This creates the central tension in the current BTC setup: crypto-specific demand is improving, but macro liquidity remains restrictive.\n\n4. Weak market participation limits conviction\nCurrent trading volume is substantially below recent norms. That matters because low-volume rallies are more vulnerable to reversal: relatively small order flows can move price, but those moves provide weaker evidence of broad market conviction.\n\nKey Risk\nRegulatory progress could further strengthen institutional participation, but security incidents, reduced corporate accumulation, or renewed macro tightening could offset that support.",

        body: "1. Treasury yields are the dominant near-term driver\nThe 30-year Treasury yield reached 5.31%, while the latest auction cleared near 5.22%. For a technology-heavy index, this matters directly: higher risk-free rates increase the discount rate applied to long-duration earnings, putting pressure on equity valuations even when company fundamentals remain unchanged. Heavy Treasury supply and weaker foreign demand are also keeping term premiums elevated, reinforcing the rate headwind.\n\n2. Inflation remains too sticky for an easy policy pivot\nU.S. CPI held at 3.40% YoY and 0.10% MoM. Inflation is no longer accelerating sharply, but it remains high enough to constrain the Federal Reserve's ability to ease policy aggressively. That leaves Nasdaq exposed to a \"higher-for-longer\" rate environment.\n\n3. Growth is weakening at an awkward time\nRetail sales fell 0.60% MoM, while core retail sales declined 0.30%. Normally, weaker consumption could support expectations for easier monetary policy. But with inflation still elevated, softer growth currently creates a less favorable combination: slower demand without immediate relief from high discount rates.\n\n4. FOMC communication is the next catalyst\nThe upcoming FOMC minutes are important because the market needs clarity on whether policymakers are becoming more concerned about slowing growth or remain primarily focused on inflation persistence. A hawkish interpretation would likely keep yields elevated and prolong valuation pressure. A more dovish signal could reduce the discount-rate headwind, but follow-through would still require confirmation from subsequent inflation and labor-market data.",
